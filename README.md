### Tools used

1. Used IntersectionObserver API.
2. Used a separate image component for changing layout from 'portrait' to 'landscape'

### Note

This is a very basic component for now. Will improve it and also add some test cases.

### Need help,

In solving some snap-scroll bug when there are smaller width images in the carousel.

### Usage

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```
